Hello! I am an SSE at [Veridise](https://veridise.com) working on the Vanguard
team to help secure [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)
focusing on [zero knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) proofs.

I completed a M.S. in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) in December of 2022 studying Programming Languages in the [UToPiA group](https://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) under [Dr. Işil Dillig](https://cs.utexas.edu/~isil).
My time at UT was funded by the [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://krellinst.org/csgf), where I was a 2020 fellow.
While at UT, I researched program synthesis, verification, and analysis.

I finished a B.S. in Mathematics at [Baylor University](https://baylor.edu/math) in May, 2020.

Research
======================

High Performance Computing
--------------------------

Programming Languages
---------------------

I worked to automate the implementation of certain concurrent programs
from a declarative specification
with [Dr. Işil Dillig](https://cs.utexas.edu/~isil), [Dr. James Bornholt](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/),
and [Dr. Kostas Ferles](https://kferles.github.io/). Check out the paper [here](https://bensepanski.github.io/publication/2022-12-01-Synthesizing-fine-grained-synchronization-protocols-for-implicit-monitors)!

I'm currently looking into automated approaches for GPU code generation. Check back for more updates!

Scientific Computing
--------------------

At Baylor I worked with [Dr. Robert Kirby](https://www.baylor.edu/math/index.php?id=90540)
on projects related to the [Firedrake project](https://www.firedrakeproject.org),
an open-source domain-specific language for computations using [the finite element method](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method).
We worked with [Dr. Andreas Kloeckner](https://mathema.tician.de/aboutme/) to
integrate [pytential](https://documen.tician.de/pytential) into Firedrake
so that we could
use [fast multipole methods](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_multipole_method)
to approximate boundary conditions at infinity on a truncated domain
(see, for example, the [Sommerfeld radiation condition](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommerfeld_radiation_condition)
 for the [Helmholtz equation](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_equation)).

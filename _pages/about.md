Hello! I am the CSO at [Veridise](https://veridise.com).
We perform audits of [zero knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) (ZK) circuits and [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract),
come check us out if you want an audit!

In my current role I handle timeline estimation, scheduling, and general audit management at Veridise. As I have time, I also perform audits!

I have audited [AMM](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm)s, vaults,
reward contracts, and more in EVM chains and NEAR.
At Veridise, I have also gotten to work in many ZK applications,
including identity systems, spam prevention, L1 blockchains, recursive provers,
trusted machine learning, and more! This includes work in [halo2](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/),
[arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs), [gnark](https://github.com/Consensys/gnark), [o1js](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/o1js), and [circom](https://docs.circom.io).
I've also reviewed core key management infrastructure built using [TEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment)s in [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services).

I used to work on the Vanguard team to help secure contracts and circuits programmatically.

I completed a M.S. in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) in December of 2022 studying Programming Languages in the [UToPiA group](https://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) under [Dr. Işil Dillig](https://cs.utexas.edu/~isil).
My time at UT was funded by the [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://krellinst.org/csgf), where I was a [2020 fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/alumni/profile?n=sepanski2020).
While at UT, I researched program synthesis, verification, and analysis.

I finished a B.S. in Mathematics at [Baylor University](https://baylor.edu/math) in May, 2020.

Research
======================


Programming Languages
---------------------

I worked to automate the implementation of certain concurrent programs
from a declarative specification
with [Dr. Işil Dillig](https://cs.utexas.edu/~isil), [Dr. James Bornholt](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/),
and [Dr. Kostas Ferles](https://kferles.github.io/).

Check out the paper [here](../publication/2022-12-01-Synthesizing-fine-grained-synchronization-protocols-for-implicit-monitors)!

High Performance Computing
--------------------------

I worked with [Dr. Samuel Williams](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computer-science-amcr/par/members/staff/samuel-williams/) and [Dr. Hans Johansen](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computational-science-dept/anag/about/staff-and-postdocs/hans-johansen/)
in [CRD at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs](https://crd.lbl.gov) in the summer
of 2021 (and throughout the year) on the [Bricks project](https://github.com/CtopCsUtahEdu/bricklib) to help transform data layout (instead of code) for high-performance codes.

Check out the paper [here](../publication/2022-11-13-Maximizing-performance-through-memory-hierarchy-driven-data-layout-transformations).

Scientific Computing
--------------------

At Baylor I worked with [Dr. Robert Kirby](https://www.baylor.edu/math/index.php?id=90540)
on projects related to the [Firedrake project](https://www.firedrakeproject.org),
an open-source domain-specific language for computations using [the finite element method](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method).
We worked with [Dr. Andreas Kloeckner](https://mathema.tician.de/aboutme/) to
integrate [pytential](https://documen.tician.de/pytential) into Firedrake
so that we could
use [fast multipole methods](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_multipole_method)
to approximate boundary conditions at infinity on a truncated domain
(see, for example, the [Sommerfeld radiation condition](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommerfeld_radiation_condition)
 for the [Helmholtz equation](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_equation)).

Check out the paper [here](../publication/2021-05-10-Finite-elements-for-Helmholtz-equations-with-a-nonlocal-boundary-condition).

Hello all! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science Department at UT Austin](https://cs.utexas.edu) studying
in the [UToPiA group](https://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) under [Dr. Işil Dillig](https://cs.utexas.edu/~isil).
I am also a second-year fellow of the [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://krellinst.org/csgf).
My research revolves around using program synthesis and verification problems to
solve high-performance computing issues in the scientific domains.

I finished a B.S. in Mathematics at [Baylor University](https://baylor.edu/math) in May, 2020.

Current Research
======================

I worked to automate the implementation of certain concurrent programs
from a declarative specification
with [Dr. Işil Dillig](https://cs.utexas.edu/~isil), [Dr. James Bornholt](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/),
and [Dr. Kostas Ferles](https://kferles.github.io/). Check out the paper [here](https://bensepanski.github.io/publication/2022-12-01-Synthesizing-fine-grained-synchronization-protocols-for-implicit-monitors)!

I'm currently looking into automated approaches for GPU code generation. Check back for more updates!

Undergraduate Research
======================

At Baylor I worked with [Dr. Robert Kirby](https://www.baylor.edu/math/index.php?id=90540)
on projects related to the [Firedrake project](https://www.firedrakeproject.org),
an open-source domain-specific language for computations using [the finite element method](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method).
We worked with [Dr. Andreas Kloeckner](https://mathema.tician.de/aboutme/) to
integrate [pytential](https://documen.tician.de/pytential) into Firedrake
so that we could
use [fast multipole methods](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_multipole_method)
to approximate boundary conditions at infinity on a truncated domain
(see, for example, the [Sommerfeld radiation condition](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommerfeld_radiation_condition)
 for the [Helmholtz equation](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_equation)).

Presented my research from the [2017 San Diego State University Research Experience for Undergraduates](http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/math-reu/index.html) during the [AMS-MAA-SIAM Special Session on Research in Mathematics by Undergraduates and Students in Post-Baccalaureate Programs](https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org//meetings/national/jmm2018/2197_program_ss19.html)  at the [2018 Joint Mathematics Meetings](https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2018/2197_intro) in San Diego, California. This talk was funded by an [MAA Travel Grant for Undergraduates](https://www.maa.org/programs/maa-grants) and by the [Mathematics Department at Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu/math/).

# Abstract

Several new explicit formulas for certain augmented Hilbert Series measuring maximal and minimal factorization lengths for all numerical semigroups are presented. A weighted type of Euler characteristic of an associated simplicial complex is a key element of some of these formulas.

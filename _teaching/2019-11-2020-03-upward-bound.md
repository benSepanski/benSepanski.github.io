[The Upward Bound Program](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/trioupbound/index.html) is an initiative by the [U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/) for "high school students from low-income families; and high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree." The goal of this program is "increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from institutions of postsecondary education." I worked as a paid tutor in general mathematics/physics as well as for the math/science portion of the [ACT](http://www.act.org/) and [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/) tests.

I acted as a tutor from November 2019 through March 2020. Although my time as a tutor was cut short by the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), I was unable to continue tutoring after graduation due to my enrollment in graduate school.

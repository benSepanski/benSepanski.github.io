[The Upward Bound Program](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/trioupbound/index.html) is an initiative by the [U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/) for "high school students from low-income families; and high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree." The goal of this program is "increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from institutions of postsecondary education." I worked as a paid tutor in general mathematics/physics as well as the math/science portion of the [ACT](http://www.act.org/) and [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/) tests.

Supervisor: [Stephanie Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-bailey-471b05161/), Upward Bound Coordinator at ESC Region 12.
